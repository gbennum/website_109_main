	<div class="about-building-text-container">109 Main was originally two buildings, Buzzell's Variety Store (right) and a brick home (left).  In 1856, both buildings were bought by Hiram G. Madeup and connected.  For the past 60 years, the connected building was owned by the Lackey family, with the family living in the house and owning the renamed Lackey's Store</div>

	<div class="about-building-text-container">The building was remodeled in 2015-16.  In addition to the brick house and Lackey's Store, there were four apartments that had not been rented out and were vacant since the 1960s.  The entire building had major structural issues that needed to be addressed, leading to a gutting and reinforcement of the original post and beam architecture.  Newly redesigned and updated, the apartment and shop spaces have been brought in to the 21st century while preserving their historical quality.  From bedroom dormers to original wood flooring, the authentic charm of the building remains intact.</div>
